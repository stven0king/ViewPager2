/**
 * Watcher that uses a [CountingIdlingResource] to keep track of the idling state of a ViewPager2. A
 * ViewPager2 is idle when it is in [ViewPager2.SCROLL_STATE_IDLE]. To work around a bug in Espresso
 * where touch input is blocked when IdlingResources are not idle, this watcher will only flip its
 * idling state to not idle when [waitForIdle] is called while ViewPager2 is not idle. Once the
 * ViewPager2 reaches the idle state, the watcher will remain idle until waitForIdle is called again
 * during ViewPager2's non-idle state.
 *
 * @constructor Creates a ViewPagerIdleWatcher that keeps track of the given ViewPager2's idle
 * state. It will register its IdlingResource and starts listening to the viewPager's
 * OnPageChangeCallbacks on creation. Call [unregister] to remove its IdlingResource and stop
 * listening to viewPager.
